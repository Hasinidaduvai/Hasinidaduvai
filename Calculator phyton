Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). 


import operator

# Prompt the user to enter the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Prompt the user to choose an operation
operation = input("Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the selected operation
result = 0
if operation == "+":
    result = operator.add(num1, num2)
elif operation == "-":
    result = operator.sub(num1, num2)
elif operation == "*":
    result = operator.mul(num1, num2)
elif operation == "/":
    result = operator.truediv(num1, num2)
else:
    print("Invalid operation")

# Display the result to the user
print("The result is:", result)


Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): +
The result is: 15.0
